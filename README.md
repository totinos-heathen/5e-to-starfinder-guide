# 5e to Starfinder

## Sourcebooks

By gear, I mean weapons, armor, armor upgrades, augmentations, weapon fusions, tech items, magic items, hybrid items, drugs, etc.

### Starfinder Core Rulebook (CRB)
**Impact:** Absolutely necessary.

This is your primary source of information.

* Basic rules (character creation, leveling up, combat, starship combat, equipment)
* Classes: Envoy, Mechanic, Mystic, Operative, Solarian, Soldier, Technomancer
* Basic lore about the setting (Pact Worlds centric, but mentions of other systems)

### Character Operations Manual (COM)
**Impact:** Adds flexibility and more options. Very significant.

* Three new classes: Biohacker, Vanguard, and Witchwarper
