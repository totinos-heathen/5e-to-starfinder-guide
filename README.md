# 5e to Starfinder

## Introduction

So you want to play Starfinder! That's great! However, if your only experience with TTRPGs is mostly limited to D&D 5e (referred to as 5e from here on), there's going to be some differences. If not, there'll still be differences, but you'll know how to cope with them.

Let's get started!

## Rolling Dice

Starfinder determines the result of "checks" much like D&D: you roll a d20, add modifiers, and if the number matches or exceeds the difficulty class (DC) or armor class (AC), the check succeeds. If not, the check fails.

However, Starfinder is much more specific than 5e about specific situations. As such, instead of granting advantage when a character is more likely to succeed or disadvantage when a character is more likely to fail, Starfinder bestows **bonuses** and **penalties**.

### How Should I Interpret Numbers?

Consider the following chart:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64822111/200140669-f244fc22-c55e-468a-ba5f-7e094987de5a.png)

It shows the numerical bonus or penalty of advantage and disadvantage in 5e, at different DCs and assuming a modifier of +0. For example, if you have advantage against a DC 10 check, that's equivalent to a +4.95 (+5) bonus. However, if you have advantage against a DC 18 check, that's only a +2.55 (+3) bonus.

Starfinder however is linear in its bonuses and penalties. If you have a +3 bonus, it applies equally regardless if the DC is 10 or 18.

#### The quick take: situational bonuses are less effective for easy checks, but more important and effective for harder checks.

### Bonuses

That's not the only difference. When 5e does add modifiers instead of advantage, they all combine together. Starfinder is like this, mostly. But sometimes, only certain bonuses may apply. This is because of **bonus types**, found on page 266 of the Core Rulebook (CRB). For example, two morale bonus types won't stack, even if they come from different sources, because you can only have one thing affecting your morale. Penalties and bonuses do not interact however, and penalties often do stack when they are of different causes.

### Summary

Expect Starfinder DCs and ACs to scale with you. As you level up, so do your challenges, and the numbers you have to beat scale linearly as much as your skills and abilities.

## Sourcebooks

By gear, I mean weapons, armor, armor upgrades, augmentations, weapon fusions, tech items, magic items, hybrid items, drugs, etc.
