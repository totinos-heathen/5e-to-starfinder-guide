# 5e to Starfinder

## Introduction

So you want to play Starfinder! That's great! However, if your only experience with TTRPGs is mostly limited to D&D 5e (referred to as 5e from here on), there's going to be some differences, which I'll outline here.

Let's get started!

## Rolling Dice

Starfinder determines the result of "checks" much like D&D: you roll a d20, add modifiers, and if the number matches or exceeds the difficulty class (DC) or armor class (AC), the check succeeds. If not, the check fails.

However, Starfinder is much more specific than 5e about specific situations. As such, instead of granting advantage when a character is more likely to succeed or disadvantage when a character is more likely to fail, Starfinder bestows **bonuses** and **penalties**.

### How Should I Interpret Numbers?

Consider the following chart:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64822111/200140669-f244fc22-c55e-468a-ba5f-7e094987de5a.png)

It shows the numerical bonus or penalty of advantage and disadvantage in 5e, at different DCs and assuming a modifier of +0. For example, if you have advantage against a DC 10 check, that's equivalent to a +4.95 (+5) bonus. However, if you have advantage against a DC 18 check, that's only a +2.55 (+3) bonus.

Starfinder however is linear in its bonuses and penalties. If you have a +3 bonus, it applies equally regardless if the DC is 10 or 18.

#### The quick take: Situational bonuses are less effective for easy checks, but more important and effective for harder checks.

### Bonuses

That's not the only difference. When 5e does add modifiers instead of advantage, they all combine together. Starfinder is like this, mostly. But sometimes only certain bonuses can take effect. This is because of **bonus types**, found on page 266 of the Core Rulebook (CRB). For example, two morale bonus types won't stack, even if they come from different sources, because you can only have one thing affecting your morale. The notable exception to this is circumstantial bonuses, which can stack if they are because of different circumstances. Do note, penalties and bonuses do not interact, and penalties often do stack when they are of different causes.

#### The quick take: Expect Starfinder DCs and ACs to scale with you. As you level up, so do your challenges, and the numbers you have to beat scale linearly as much as your skills and abilities.

## Combat

Starfinder is a much more tactical game than 5e. By this, I mean that in Starfinder, location, movement, cover, etc. are much more impactful and consequential. In other words, there are less options to directly deal damage, and more options to improve your chances to deal damage.

### Bonuses and Penalties

Because "advantage" and "disadvantage" are not things in Starfinder, and since circumstantial bonuses and penalties can stack, you can and are expected to use every edge you have to apply bonuses to yourself and penalties to your enemies. And the rules reflect this. There are bonuses for flanking, bonuses for different types of cover, penalties for being surprised, penalties for being knocked off-kilter in zero-gravity, and so on and so forth.

You cannot and will not remember each source of bonus or penalty. But you can have your character specific bonuses marked down on your character sheet, and bring up the sources in question as needed. From there, the GM can determine the resulting bonuses and penalties.

#### The quick take: Ask if a bonus would apply when you think a bonus could apply. The GM won't remember everything about every character, but they will know the general rules around what size a bonus would be.

### Ready, Set, Action!

Here is a handy cheatsheet for combat actions: https://www.reddit.com/r/starfinder_rpg/comments/fuwi0j/oc_starfinder_cheat_sheet/
I've reposted it here as well:

![Combat actions cheatsheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64822111/200154251-ec82ede0-b334-46f9-ad8e-b4fc08a24348.png)

Many of the actions in Starfinder are similar to those in 5e. However, they are not the same. Some key differences:

* Movement cannot normally be split around an attack. Either you move then attack, or attack then move.
* Full actions are used in place of your standard action, move action, and swift action. There's no comparable "uber-action" in 5e.
* Attacks of opportunity are provoked by **any** movement out of a threatened **square** other than a guarded step (move action) or the first step of a withdraw action (full action). Note, by "any" this means forced movement of any kind provokes attacks of opportunity, and "square" means that even if you remain in the threat zone of the opponent, simply moving out of a threatened square provokes the attack of opportunity.
* Attacks of opportunity are also provoked by ranged attacks and spells/spell-like abilities, unless noted otherwise.
* Recovering from being prone (standing up) is normally a move action.
* Standard actions cannot be converted to extra movement speed, other than through full actions (run and withdraw). Combined with the previous point, this means that unless you have one of the Kip-Up feats, you cannot stand up from prone and move on the same turn.
* Drawing your weapon consumes your movement action unless you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher. This doesn't matter much past levels 1 and 2.

For spellcasters,
* Concentrating on a spell is much more taxing. Each round, you must spend your standard action to concentrate on the spell.
* Dismissing a spell is much more taxing as well; it takes a standard action to dismiss a spell. However, dismissing a concentration spell does *not* cost a standard action, as dismissing it just means not concentrating on it.

In addition, there are several actions/full actions that aren't in 5e (charge, fight defensively, several of the combat maneuvers).

#### The quick take: Just read the cheatsheet.

### Life and Death

Starfinder is very different from 5e in that healing is not nearly as critical. This is because you have two health pools, Stamina Points (SP) and Hit Points (HP). In addition, your character will have a number of Resolve Points, which are related but not equivalent to health. Your SP are generally very comparable to your HP in terms of size, but they regenerate much more quickly. They are also where damage is typically allocated first. The quickest way to restore them is by spending 1 Resolve Point during a 10-minute uninterrupted rest (the equivalent of the 1-hour 5e short rest).

HP on the other hand regenerates much slower than HP in 5e, which is quite significant. For example, after an 8-hour rest, all SP and Resolve Points are restored, but only 1 HP per level is restored. At level 1 for an Ysoki Technomancer (one of the lowest starting HP builds), that's still only 1/7 of their total HP. So think of HP like your capacity for wounds, and SP as your readiness and energy.

The rules for dying, stabilization, and death are quite different from 5e. However, the similarities are:
* If you're stable, you're safe and at 0 HP for now. However, Starfinder makes long term stability without healing much more dangerous, requiring a Constitution check after 1 hour.
* If you take damage reducing you to 0 HP, if the remaining damage exceeds your maximum health, you die instantly.
* Healing a character that is dying or stable brings them back up, as if they had never been reduced to 0 HP.

Read page 250 in the CRB for more information on death and dying, but the basic idea is if you are at 0 HP and 0 Resolve Points, you are dead.

#### The quick take: Use up your Stamina Points, avoid using up your Hit Points, and be very careful of going below a quarter of your Resolve Points. 

### Weaponry and Magic

While the Galactic Magic sourcebook (GMG) has partially addressed this, the fact is that level 0 spells (equivalent to cantrips in 5e) will not usually cut it for dealing damage as a spell caster. Some higher level spells can deal a fair bit of damage, but remember the universe: why take the years of training to learn fireball when you can go out and buy a rocket launcher tomorrow? Magic is not a good source of damage in most cases. Rather, it is largely meant to improve your chances on and off the battlefield.

So if magic isn't what causes damage, what does? Grenades. Guns. Grenade guns. Big hitty sticks. Small pokey things. Basically, any weapon you could imagine, it's there. And like any gun, the bigger guns deal more damage than the smaller guns.

This is a problem for some classes that only have proficiency in Small Arms. Unless you're the operative, Small Arms (one-handed guns) will deal much less damage than Longarms (light two-handed guns). My recommendation is to get a longarm and get proficiency in a longarm with your first feat.

#### The quick take: Get a gun. A bigger gun, if you can. Unless you like hitting things directly. Then you do you.
